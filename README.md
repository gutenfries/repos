### Yeah, you're probably wondering what the heck this is.
This is just the remote version of my root folder where i store most my repos.
I keep reusable project and conf files here so my code style and whatnot stays consistent.

It's named `repos` because that is the directory where I almost always keep repos 

```yaml
Linux: '~/repos'
Win: 'C:\Users\Mark-\repos'
```
